# Software Testing project: Prime Paths
This is the final project of Software Testing course at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, Iran.
In this project we have the nodes, start node, end node and edges of a graph as inputs.
The job is to draw the graph and compute the prime paths of the graph and display them using the inputs.
This project is implemented using Python language and NetworkX library. 
Hope you enjoy it :)
